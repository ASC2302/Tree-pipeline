# Tree-pipeline
The code that is uploaded here takes a newik file of a tree of your choice and prunes it according to the species of your choice and plots out the pruned tree.
The code does this by first looking up the species you input in the tree file provided when you run the code. 
It then finds the common node/ancestor between the two species via the MRCA function and then plots out the tree from that common node/ancestor down to the lowest level.
